Hi! I am an MSc Advanced Computing student at Imperial College London. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Cornell University where I was fortunate to be able to work with Professors Wen Sun, Nathan Kallus, and Francesca Parise. 

I've also worked as a Trading Analyst at Maven Securities, and interned at Citi and Amazon (Amazon Web Services).
