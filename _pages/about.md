Hi! I am an MSc Advanced Computing student at Imperial College London. I'm currently working with Professor Marek Rei and Dr. Kris Cao of Cohere on research to devise optimal strategies for pre-training language models with multiple domains of data and token budgets. At Imperial, I also worked with Professor Francesca Toni to research large language model uncertainty quantification methods and their integration with the argumentative large language model framework to improve performance on downstream claim verification tasks. 

Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Cornell University where I was fortunate to be able to work with Professors Wen Sun and Nathan Kallus on distributional reinforcement learning, and Francesca Parise on machine learning in networks. I've also worked in industry as a Trading Analyst at Maven Securities, and I interned at Citi as a Quantitative Analysis Summer Analyst and Amazon Web Services as a Software Development Engineer intern.
