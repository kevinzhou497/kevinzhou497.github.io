Hi! I am an MSc Advanced Computing student at Imperial College London. I'm currently working with Professor Francesca Toni to research confidence and uncertainty in large language models along with potential calibration methods and applications to explainable AI. 

Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Cornell University where I was fortunate to be able to work with Professors Wen Sun and Nathan Kallus on distributional reinforcement learning, and Francesca Parise on machine learning in networks. I've also worked in industry as a Trading Analyst at Maven Securities, and I interned at Citi as a Quantitative Analysis Summer Analyst and Amazon as a Software Development Engineer intern.
