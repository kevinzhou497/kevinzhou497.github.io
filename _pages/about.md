Hi! I am currently a Machine Learning Scientist at Abridge, working on AI to help improve healthcare and the lives of clinicians.

Previously, I was an MSc Advanced Computing student at Imperial College London where I had the pleasure of being supervised by Professor Marek Rei and Dr. Kris Cao of Cohere for my dissertation on efficient optimal data mixing strategies for pre-training language models. I also worked with Professor Francesca Toni to research large language model uncertainty quantification methods and their integration with the argumentative large language model framework. Before Imperial, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Cornell University where I was fortunate to be able to work with Professors Wen Sun and Nathan Kallus on distributional reinforcement learning.
